Recoup is an autonomous revenue recovery agent pipeline that detects failed or at-risk transactions, **diagnoses the root cause of failure** (not just the failure code), executes bounded recovery interventions (retries, localized WhatsApp reminders), tracks every step in a central append-only audit trail, and escalates unresolved cases to a human review queue.

## The Problem

Most "revenue recovery" tooling reacts to a failed payment the same way every time: retry it, or fire off a generic reminder. But `insufficient_funds`, `bank_server_timeout`, and `card_expired` are not the same problem, and treating them the same way wastes retries, annoys customers, and leaves recoverable revenue on the table.

Recoup's core bet: **diagnose before you act.** A deterministic rules engine decides what happens next only after the true failure cause is known — and every action, spend cap, and escalation is logged so the whole decision trail can be audited after the fact.

**At a glance, from a 52-transaction evaluation batch:**

| | |
|---|---|
| 💰 **Recovered** | ₹5,61,850 of ₹23,58,150 at risk (23.8%) |
| ✅ **Recovery rate** | 61.54% of failed transactions recovered |
| 🎯 **Classifier accuracy** | 98.08% (rules + Groq fallback) |
| ⚡ **Avg. touches to recovery** | 1.06 |

## Why Recoup

- **Diagnosis-first, not blind retries.** Every failure is classified to a root cause before any action is chosen, so the intervention actually fits the problem (a retry for a `bank_server_timeout`, a payment link for `insufficient_funds`, escalation for repeated `card_expired`).
- **AI proposes, code decides.** Language models classify ambiguous failures and draft customer copy; a deterministic Python state machine — not the LLM — owns retry caps, spend limits, and escalation boundaries. No hallucinated discounts, no double-charges, no budget bypasses.
- **Built for the Indian market.** WhatsApp nudges are drafted in Hinglish for retail customers and professional English for business/SMB partners, matching how Indian merchants actually communicate with customers.
- **Fails safe.** Both Groq calls run under a 5-second timeout with automatic fallback to `needs_human_review` — a slow or unavailable model degrades the pipeline gracefully instead of blocking it.
- **Fully auditable.** Every rule check, AI call, and human action is appended to a central audit trail, tagged by actor (`RULE` / `AI` / `HUMAN`) — the kind of trail a finance or compliance team would actually want to see.
- **Evaluated, not just demoed.** A 52-transaction synthetic batch with unit tests on the decision engine and classifier back up the numbers in this README (see [Testing & Reliability](#testing--reliability)).

## Pipeline Architecture

Every stage writes to the same append-only audit log before the next stage reads from it. Only two nodes ever call an LLM — everything that touches money or limits (`Decide`) is plain, reproducible Python.

> **Note:** the `payment_link` node calls Razorpay's API directly, using test-mode keys for the buildathon submission. Swapping in a live key is the only change needed to move this to production.
**Legend:** 🟩 AI / LLM call (Groq) · 🟧 deterministic rules only — no LLM in this step · 🟥 hard stop → human handoff

## Failure Recovery — A Staged Example

A revenue-recovery agent is only trustworthy if it also knows when to *stop*. This walkthrough (also in [`demo/staged_failure.md`](demo/staged_failure.md)) stages a transaction that has already exhausted its retry cap, to show the pipeline catching that itself instead of looping forever.

**Scenario:** a card payment has failed 3 times with `card_expired`, and the retry cap in `decide.py` is 3.

```text
[14:02:11] ingest.event     txn_id=TXN-0148  reason_raw="card declined - expired"
[14:02:11] diagnose.result  root_cause=card_expired  confidence=0.97  source=rule_match
[14:02:12] decide.check     retry_count=3  retry_cap=3  status=CAP_REACHED
[14:02:12] decide.block     action=instant_retry  reason="stopping rule: retry cap reached — will not re-attempt"  actor=RULE
[14:02:12] escalate.route   queue=human_review  note="card expired, 3/3 retries used — needs an updated-card link sent manually"  actor=RULE
[14:02:12] audit.write      outcome=stopped_safely  logged=true
```

What this demonstrates: the stop isn't an accident or an unhandled exception — it's a rule (`decide.py`) that anticipated this exact case, blocked the action *before* it fired, wrote down why, and handed the case to a human with context instead of silently failing. That reasoning trail, not just the outcome, is what `escalate.py` and the audit log in `track.py` exist to make provable.

## Core Product Capabilities

### 🛡️ Strict AI-vs-Rules Design Split
This project enforces a hard boundary between generative/heuristic AI decisions and deterministic execution rules:

| Used for AI | Kept 100% deterministic |
|---|---|
| **Fallback diagnosis** — classifying ambiguous, free-text failure logs (e.g. *"bank server timed out connecting to cardholder"* or *"declined by issuer due to no credit remaining"*) into standard operational codes. | **Retry & spend caps** — how many times, and how much, can be retried is a fixed limit in `decide.py`, never an LLM judgment call. |
| **Personalized copywriting** — drafting WhatsApp billing reminders in Hinglish for retail customers and professional English for business/SMB partners. | **Which intervention fires** — the (root cause × attempt count) → action mapping is a lookup table, so it's reproducible on replay and auditable line by line. |
| | **Escalation boundaries** — compliance-sensitive, so the rule can't drift between runs the way a model's output can. |

> **The one-line version:** AI decides what to say and how to read an ambiguous signal; rules decide what happens to money.

### ⚡ High-Performance Groq LLM Integration
* **Classifier model**: `openai/gpt-oss-120b` — larger, higher-reasoning model used for classification accuracy.
* **Drafting model**: `openai/gpt-oss-20b` — smaller, low-latency model for message copy generation.
* Both run under a **5.0-second timeout** with automatic fallback to `needs_human_review`, so a slow model call never blocks the pipeline.

### 🌍 Context-Aware Localization (English vs. Hinglish)
A recovery nudge only works if the customer actually resonates with the message. Instead of rigid templates, Recoup uses a low-latency Groq model to draft personalized WhatsApp messages based on the customer profile and the specific failure reason. 

It seamlessly switches between professional English for B2B clients and conversational Hinglish for retail users, matching how Indian merchants natively communicate.

| Target Audience | Root Cause | AI-Drafted WhatsApp Nudge (Example) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enterprise / B2B** | `bank_server_timeout` | *"Dear Partner, your scheduled payment for Invoice #1244 (₹15,000) failed due to a temporary bank timeout. Please use the secure fallback link below to complete the transaction."* |
| **Retail / D2C** | `insufficient_funds` | *"Hi Rahul, aapka ₹1,200 ka payment fail ho gaya hai. Shayad account mein balance kam tha. Naya link niche hai, aap dusre UPI app ya card se try kar sakte ho. 🙏"* |

## Evaluation Performance Metrics

Run against a synthetic batch of **52 transaction failures** spanning card declines, checkout abandonments, subscription failures, and overdue receivables (`eval/run_eval.py`).

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total ingested transactions** | 52 |
| **Recovered transactions** | 32 (61.54%) |
| **Escalated transactions** | 20 (38.46%) |
| **Total at-risk revenue** | ₹23,58,150.00 |
| **Recovered revenue** | ₹5,61,850.00 (23.83%) |
| **Average touches to recovery** | 1.06 |
| **Classifier accuracy (rules + Groq)** | **98.08%** |

**Audit log actor breakdown**
* `RULE` — 216 invocations (state routing, spend caps, retry limits)
* `AI` — 72 invocations (Groq classification, Hinglish message drafting)
* `HUMAN` — 17 invocations (simulated customer payments in response to nudges)

---

## Testing & Reliability

* `tests/test_decide.py` — verifies retry caps, spend limits, and state transitions never bypass the rules engine.
* `tests/test_diagnose.py` — verifies rule-based classification routing and the Groq fallback path, including timeout behavior.
* `eval/run_eval.py` — replays the full 52-transaction batch end-to-end and produces the metrics above.

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/test_decide.py tests/test_diagnose.py   # Windows
python -m pytest tests/test_decide.py tests/test_diagnose.py                 # macOS/Linux
```

### 🧪 How Judges Can Test Live in 30 Seconds (No Code/Setup Required)
We built a **Live Webhook Simulator** directly into the home page:
1. Open the [Live Dashboard](https://recoup-seven-omega.vercel.app) (Razorpay-inspired light fintech theme).
2. On the **Home** tab, find the **Simulate Razorpay Webhook Failure** form.
3. Fill in the details (Customer Name, Amount, Failure Reason) and click **Send Simulation Webhook**.
4. Click **Audit Log Trail** in the header to watch the recovery pipeline execute in real time.
5. Click **WhatsApp Outbox** to see the personalized English/Hinglish copy drafted for that customer.
6. Click **All Transactions** to see overall metrics and recovery status across the batch.

> ⏱️ Note for judges: the API is hosted on Render's free tier, which spins down when idle. The **first** request after a period of inactivity may take 20–30 seconds to wake up — this is a hosting artifact, not pipeline latency.
